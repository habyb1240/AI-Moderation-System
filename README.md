# üß† AI Moderation System

This project implements a **basic AI moderation system** using the **OpenAI API**.  
It checks both **user inputs** and **AI outputs** to ensure that harmful or disallowed content is filtered out before being processed or displayed.

- Input moderation ‚Äî blocks user prompts containing banned keywords.
- Output moderation ‚Äî replaces disallowed words in AI responses with `[REDACTED]`.
- Uses **OpenAI GPT model** to generate intelligent responses.
- Designed for **students in health sciences and computer information technology**.

### 2. User Prompt
Collected dynamically from the user through input.

### 3. API Call
A POST request is sent to the OpenAI API endpoint with moderation logic.

### 4. Moderation Logic
